## Yet another repository with book exercises

Solutions to exercises from a great book (Data analysis using regression and multilevel hierarchical models)[http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/]. The book implies it to be in R, but due to python being my main tool for dealing with data, I wanted to work on both, the book exercises and improving my python statistical toolbox skills.
